    <h1>BITE KNIGHTS</h1>
    <p class="aboutus slide-in" style="color: yellow">
        It all started back in late September in YS-2. Two friends, Tejas Hamane and Aryan Kesarkar, from Room No. 107, decided to start a little something
       for their friends. You see, the hostel order timings were suddenly cut short, and everyone was getting hungry! So, Bite Knights was born to save the day
       (and night!). What started as a small venture between two buddies quickly became a popular spot for late-night cravings. Even though the original
       partners have since gone their separate ways, the spirit of Bite Knights lives on. We've taken a short break for the Diwali vacation, but we're excited
       to come back soon, better than ever. We can't wait to serve you again!
