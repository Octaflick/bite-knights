    <h1>BITE KNIGHTS</h1>
    <p class="aboutus slide-in" style="color: yellow;">
        Bite Knights began in late September in YS-2 as a passion business by two hostelmates from Room No.107. <br>
        Tejas Hamane and Aryan Kesarkar, due to unforseen circumstances our hostel order timings were cut short resulting in high demand.<br>
        Later, the partners parted ways but i still decided to create a minor project out of it<br>
        Currently Bite-Knights is closed due to diwali vacation but we have hopes for its reboot
