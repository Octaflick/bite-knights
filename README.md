# Bite-Knights

## Introduction

Bite Knights started as a passion project by two hostelmates, Tejas Hamane and Aryan Kesarkar, in YS-2, Room No. 107. The venture was born out of a need for late-night snacks due to shortened hostel order timings. Although the original partnership dissolved, the project has been continued as a minor project. Currently, Bite-Knights is on a temporary hiatus due to the Diwali vacation, but there are hopes for its revival.
